From the interaction of theory and practice, a useful class of models for the purposes at hand is considered.\n\n2. Because this class is too expensive to be conveniently fitted directly to data, rough methods for identifying subclass of these models are developed. Such methods of model identification employ data and knowledge of the system to suggest an appropriate parsimonious subclass of models which may tentatively entertained. In addition, the identification process can be used to yield rough preliminary estimates of the parameters in the model.\n\n3. The tentatively entertained model is fitted to the data and the parameters in the model are to be estimated. The estimates obtained during the identification stage can now be used as initial values in more refined iterative methods for estimating the parameters.\n\n4. Diagnostic checks are applied with the object of uncovering possible lack of fit and diagnosing the cause. If no lack of fit is indicated, the model is ready to use. If any inadequacy is found, the iterative cycle of identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking is repeated until a suitable representation is found.\n\n[image:rId140] The image illustrates the process of model selection and evaluation in data mining using ECMiner, including postulating models, identifying candidates, estimating parameters, diagnostic checking, and applying the model for forecasting or control.\n\n[Image:rId140] The image illustrates the process of model selection and evaluation in data mining using ECMiner, including postulating models, identifying candidates, estimating parameters, diagnostic checking, and applying the model for forecasting or control.\n\nTo put it simply,\n\n1.

The innovative aspect of this methodology is to modify the assumption that random shocks have constant variance in the time series analysis so far, and introduce the assumption that random shocks have constant variance unconditionally, but the conditional variance depend on time t. Robert Engle proposed the ARCH Model in 1982, and the generalized ARCH model, that is, the GARCH model, was proposed by Bollerslev in 1986 and various modified models such as EGARCH, GARCH-M, and GJR have been presented since then. The reason why many modified models of ARCH have been presented and received a lot of attention is because with the development of financial economics, not only time series prediction but also measurement and prediction of volatility (variance) have become very important. In many capital asset pricing models, the volatility of the underlying asset has been considered an important factor affecting the price of the asset, but the methodology for measuring and predicting this volatility had not been developed before ARCH. Research related to this has continued steadily not only in the 1980s, but also since then, and even recently, the GARCH model is now used in various engineering fields, especially network traffic analysis, in addition to financial economics.",

It is commonly used in destructive testing and in systems where once one operator measures a part, no other operator can measure the same part. It is essential to assume that parts within each batch are nearly identical. If this assumption is violated, operators will measure different parts, making it unclear whether the variation is due to part differences or issues in the measurement system.
