In this process, the input signal advances layer-by-layer. Each layer's neurons (or nodes) are connected to those in other layers through connections that have a bias and an adjustable weight. The figure below illustrates the structure of an NN with two hidden layers.\n[image:rId275]\nBackpropagation is a widely used algorithm in training artificial neural networks, primarily for minimizing the error by adjusting the weights through gradient descent. consists of two stages:\n\n[Image:rId275]\n\n(1) Forward pass\n\nThe input is passed through the network layer by layer. It passes through the input and hidden layers in the forward direction. Finally, the network produces output, which is an estimate of the desired output, at the output layer. During the forward pass, the network computes its output, but the weights remain unchanged.\n\n(2) Backward pass (Backpropagation)\n\nThe weights are updated in the backward direction based on the error correction rule (back propagation algorithm).

It is a type of feed-forward neural network that automatically learns features from images through filter or kernel optimization. CNN is widely used for characterizing and classifying of 2D data, such as images, across various field.\n[image:rId321]\nThe figure above illustrates a CNN architecture, like LeNet-5, using convolutional and subsampling layers to extract features, and fully connected layers for digit recognition.\nConvolutional neural networks comprise three primary types of layers.\n\n[Image:rId321]\n\n(1) Convolution layer The convolutional layer is the most important feature of a CNN, applying filters to the previous layer’s feature map to generate a new, more compact, and informative feature map. The filters move across the input with a set stride, controlling the amount of overlap and affecting the size of the output. Padding is often used in convolutional layers to control the output size and preserve information at the edges. In certain CNN architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet, both stride and padding values are fixed for each layer type and cannot be modified.\n\n(2) Pooling layer The pooling layer, or sub-sampling layer, reduces the number of weights parameters by down sampling, optimizing computational efficiency and mitigating overfitting.\n\n(3) Fully connected layer Finally, the fully connected layer, or classification layer, processes the extracted features and performs classification. The output of the final fully connected layer is a probability map, indicating the likelihood of the input image belonging to each class. The class with the highest probability is considered the final classification result.\n\n[image:rId322]\n\n[Image:rId322]",

When the batch size approaches the size of the entire dataset, it behaves similarly to one-batch gradient descent, which updates the entire dataset at once. This makes it robust to outliers but weak against local minima. Conversely, when the batch size is closer to 1, the updates become more like stochastic gradient descent, making it less resistant to outliers but better at escaping local minima. By adjusting the batch size, we can balance between outlier resistance and the ability to overcome the local minima problem.\n\nOptimization algorithm\n\n(1) Gradient Descent with Momentum\n\nWeights are updated in a way similar to the concept of inertia, where an object tends to continue moving in the same direction. The closer the Momentum coefficient is to 1, the more it maintains the current direction, while values which are closer to 0 approach standard gradient descent. When the Momentum coefficient is 1, a new gradient is added without changing the current direction. Conversely, if the Momentum coefficient is 0, it is identical to regular gradient descent.\n\n(2) Adagrad\n\nFor variables that fluctuate significantly during training, we reduce the learning rate. For instance, if one variable is updated more frequently than a no ther, its learning rate is adjusted accordingly.\n\n(3) RMSProp\n\nAdagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, but it can get stuck with a very low learning rate due to accumulating past gradients. RMSprop addresses this by giving more weight to recent gradients, preventing the learning rate from becoming too small too quickly.\n\n(4) ADAM\n\nAdam is a learning method that combines the stren g ths of momentum and RMSprop. Momentum helps maintain the direction of movement, while RMSprop reduces the learning rate for frequently updated variables. Adam uses two hyperparameters beta1 and beta2. The closer the Beta1 value is to 1, like the momentum coefficient, the more it maintains the direction in which the gradient value is moving. The Beta2 value is a ratio that maintains the size of the gradient before the current point, similar to the gamma value of RMSProp. The closer the Beta2 value is to 1, the greater the influence of reducing the current learning strength due to the previous update time.",

It generates a dendrogram, a tree-like structure that illustrates how data objects are grouped. The vertical axis of the dendrogram shows the similarities (or distances) between clusters.\n\n(1) Distance Measure\n\nHierarchical clustering differs depending on distance measure and linkage method. The distance between clusters or data points influences whether they are merged or not.\n\n[Table:t1835]\n\nIf p=1 for Minkowski, then it corresponds to the Manhattan distance. If p=2 for Minkowski, then it corresponds to the Euclidean distance.\n\nHamming distance and Jaccard distance are effective for evaluating similarity of binary vectors or text.\n\n(2) Linkage Method\n\nLinkage method determines the distance criteria used to decide whether clusters should be merged. This approach ensures that the impact on the overall structure of the clustering is kept as small as possible. Linkage methods are as follows.\n\n[Table:t1843]\n\n(3) Cluster Criterion\n\nUsers can select a Cluster criterion based on their objectives.\n\n1. The Number of clusters specifies how many groups will be formed.\n\n2. Distance threshold is to cut the dendrogram at a cert a in level to determine the number of clusters. The advantage of Distance threshold is that users do not have to fix the number of clusters. If the distance threshold is low, you will get more clusters. If the distance threshold is high, you will get fewer clusters.\n\n(4) Preprocessing Method\n\nTwo preprocessing techniques, standardization and mean correction, can be applied before clustering. Standardization scales the dataset so that it has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. Mean correction subtracts the mean from each data point, resulting in an adjusted dataset with a mean of 0.",

Each sample is treated as a point in an n-dimensional space, with new samples classified based on the most common category among their k nearest neighbors in this space.\nK-NN uses train data, but it doesn’t derive rules from the train data. K-NN finds the closest samples in the train data to the new sample and classifies the new sample into the most common category among these nearby samples.\n\n(1) K-Value selection\n\nThe choice ‘k’ is crucial for new data point to assign to the category.\n\nA small k can lead to overfitting, while a large k might result in underfitting. Cross-Validation helps test various k-values to identify the optimal one for the model.\n\n(2) Data Preprocessing\n\nIf data preprocessing is need, then you may do Standardization or Mean Correction in the Preprocessing Method option. Mean Correction is adjusting the data each variable's mean to zero.\n\n(3) Leave-One-Out setup\n\nLeave-One-Out setup is the process of evaluating each data individually to ensure thorough assessment of the model's performance, reducing bias, and improving generalization. In Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), the model is trained on all data except one, which is used for testing. This process repeats for each data, ensuring each is tested once. The final LOOCV error is the average error rate across all iterations, offering an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization error.",

One of the key inputs in LOF is the number of neighbors (k), which determines how many neighboring points are considered computing the local density.\nTo identify whether a point is an outlier, LOF compares the densities of each point to its neighbors. If a point has a lower density compared to its neighbors, it is considered an anomaly. The extent of this deviation is quantified through an outlier threshold score, which determines the boundary between normal points and potential anomalies. The LOF score for point A is calculated as:\n\n[image:rId395]\n\n[Image:rId395]\n\nThe distance measurement method is a key parameter.

If the dependent variable has three or more categories, use Nominal Logistic Regression\n\n(1) Variable Selection\n\nVariable selection is the process of selecting important variables. In the Variable Selection Technique option, you can choose Stepwise, Forward, Backward, or None. Forward selection adds from the most important variable to least important one in the model, while Backward selection removes unimportant variables from a full model. Stepwise selection combines with Forward, Backward methods to iteratively add or remove variables, refining the model with significant predictors.\n\n(2) Link Function\n\nThe link function transforms the nonlinear relationship between independent and dependent variables into probabilities. Link functions such as Logit, Probit (Normit), and Gompertz can be selected from the options.\n\n[Table:t2119]\n\n(3) Log-likelihood Function\n\nThe log-likelihood function measures how well the model parameters fit the given data, and by maximizing this function, the optimal parameters of the model are determined.

Naïve Bayes model highly relies on the assumption that all features are independent of each other. Naïve Bayes defines probability through the calculations below.\n\nP Y i | x1,…, x n = P y i)P(x1,…, x n y i P x1 … x n\n\nP y i x1,…, x n = the probability of the value y in state x1,…, x n\n\ny i = dependent variable\n\nx1 … x n = independent variable\n\nThere are several variations of the Naïve Bayes model, depending whether the feature is continuous or discrete. When the feature is continuous, Gaussian Naïve Bayes is applied assuming that the feature follows a Gaussian distribution. The probability of the feature is calculated using the Gaussian distribution formula. However, if the feature is discrete, multinomial Naïve Bayes is applied especially when the features represent counts or frequencies. The probability of the feature is calculated as the frequency within the given feature class.\nLaplace smoothing is a technique used in Naive Bayes to handle the issue of zero probabilities, which can arise when a feature value that was not observed in the training data needs to be predicted. For text classification, a word appears in a test document but was not present in the training documents of a particular class. If a word is never seen in a particular class during training, the model assigns a probability of zero to that word in the test set, which is problematic. The Laplace smoothing value is typically set to 1 and whether to use the technique can be decided in the Laplace Smoothing option.\nIn addition, the amount of influence each feature has on the classification can be personalized by selecting Manual Input in the Weighting option. If the Weighting option is set to Base Value, the weight of each feature is set to 1. Features with higher likelihood probabilities for a particular class will influence more, “weight” more heavily, in the decision for that class.",

Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, creates multiple subsets of the original dataset, allowing repeated instances. The sample size for bagging can be specified as either Percentage or Count in the Selected Variable Count of the Selection options.\nEach bootstrap subset is then used to train an individual decision tree, forming a “forest”. The options for the decision trees are Total Number of Trees, Maximum Separation Data Size, Maximum Tree Depth, Impurity Condition, Impurity Change Condition and Variable Selection Method.\nFor classification, the final output is determined by majority vote, while for regression, it is the average of the predictions made by all the trees.\nOut-of-bag (OOB) error is calculated to estimate its internal validation using OOB option in the Selection options. Since each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, the remaining data is left out (out-of-bag) and can be used to test the model. After each tree is trained, it is tested on the data points not included in its bootstrap sample. The OOB error is the average error rate across all trees and serves as an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization error.",

RBF network learns by finding a surface that best matches the patterns in the training data within this high-dimensional space.\nThe network has three layers, each with a specific role. The Input layer is responsible for connecting the network to the external environment by receiving data, often referred to as “sensory” information. The hidden layer performs a nonlinear transformation on the input data, altering it in a way that helps the network recognize complex patterns more easily. This layer uses radial-basis functions, which are the core components of the RBF network. Finally. The output layer produces the final result or prediction based on the transformed data from the hidden layer, typically combining the data in a simple, linear way.\nRBF networks are often used for solving complex pattern classification tasks by transforming the data into a high-dimensional space through a nonlinear process. This transformation makes the patterns more linearly separable compared to those in a lower-dimensional space. As a result, RBF networks typically increase the dimensionality of the hidden layer to improve performance. An important factor to consider is that the dimensionality of this hidden space plays a key role in the accuracy of the network's ability to map input to output. In simple terms, the higher the dimensionality of the hidden layer, the more precisely the network can learn to match the training data.",

RBF DDA has the limitation that performs only classification (that is, it cannot perform regression), but it shows better performance than the existing RBF.\nRBF - The easiest and most concise way to describe the DDA's algorithm is to add RBF when very new data comes in. First of all, the RBF-DDA is expressed as follows.\n\n[image:rId497]\n\n[Image:rId497]\n\nThe jth RBF of the ith class has three characteristic values as follows\n\n: Coordinates of the center of the jth RBF of the ith c lass r j i\n\n: jth sigma of ith class σ j i\n\n: jth weight of ith c lass A j i\n\nAt this time, when x data enters the RBF of the class, the following response value is obtained. j th i th\n\n[image:rId498]\n\n[Image:rId498]\n\nUsing these response values, the output of each class is as follows;\n\n[image:rId499]\n\n[Image:rId499]\n\nAt this time, x data is classified into the class with the largest value above.",

In the Variable Selection option, you can choose Stepwise or General. Stepwise selection combines with Forward, Backward methods to iteratively add or remove variables, refining the model with significant predictors. (* Forward selection adds from the most important variable to least important one in the model, while Backward selection removes unimportant variables from a full model.) General selection includes all the input independent variables.\n\n(3) Multicollinearity\n\nMulticollinearity occurs due to high correlations between independent variables.

Similar to Actor-Critic, DDPG utilizes two neural networks: one to approximate the policy (Actor) and the other to estimate the value function (Critic).\nThe Actor network observes the current state of the environment and calculates the optimal actions by following the learned policy. It is responsible for deciding which action to take at any given moment.\nThe Critic network evaluates the behavior output by the Actor using the Q function. The Critic’s loss function is used to update the Critic network, ensuring it accurately evaluates the Actor’s performance.\nThe Actor network is updated by using feedback from the Critic, which helps it learn a policy that maximizes the long-term reward.",

This allows the agent to express the potential reward for the next step by using the Q function. The Q function can be expressed as:\n\nQ function = reward + discount rate * next Q function\n\nThe reward represents the immediate value obtained, the discount rate accounts for the decrease in the value of future rewards, and the next Q function refers to the maximum Q value that can be achieved in the next stage.\nDQN (Deep Q-Network) builds on the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithm, applying Q-learning at each time step. To update the Q function, the current Q value is adjusted based on the error between the predicted value and the actual outcome, using a one-step sample.\nSince the goal of reinforcement learning is maximize cumulative rewards, DQN updates the current Q function by using the maximum possible value of the next Q function to guide the learning process.",

Unlike DDPG, TD3 uses two Critic Networks and updates them by taking the minimum of Q-value from both, leading to more stable approximation. While the Critic Networks are updated at every step, the Actor Network is updated less frequently, after a set number of steps, which reduces policy changes and makes the learning process more stable.",

Each hidden layer includes a context layer, which helps the network remember previous states.\nThe context layer has the same number of nodes as the hidden layer and retains the state values of the hidden layer through the recurrent feedback. To generate predictions for each time step, SimpleRNN calculates the influence of independence at the previous time points and uses it for prediction. This makes it a supervised neural network, suitable for a variety of applications.",

These maps provide a simplified version of the input data while trying to maintain the structure and relationships found in the original high-dimensional space. SOMs are great for converting complex, high-dimensional data into simpler, more visual forms.\nSOM operates in two phases: training and mapping.

Both methods are commonly used for regression tasks, but they offer different parameters to manage the model's complexity and error tolerance. ν ϵ\n\n(1) SVR(Epsilon): The ε parameter controls the size of the margin where errors are not penalized. The trade-off between margin size and errors is handled by the C parameter, which acts as a regularization parameter (penalty for large errors).\n\n(2) SVR(Nu): The parameter controls both the fraction of support vectors (data points used to build the model) and the number of margin violations. This offers a more direct way to control model complexity and outliers. ν\n\nThe SVR(Epsilon) sets the margin of tolerance as 𝜖, where deviations within this margin are not penalized. The 𝜖 is a threshold value that determines the width of the \"Epsilon tube\" around the regression function. Errors outside this margin are penalized proportionally as shown in the equation below.\nA larger 𝜖 allows for more tolerance, while a smaller 𝜖 demands a closer fit to the data. The 𝜖 value can be set in the Epsilon option.\nSVR(Nu) (-SVR) gives more direct control over model complexity and the number of support vectors or margin violations, using the parameter. The - (Nu) value is typically between 0 and 1. A higher value for nu will allow more margin errors and use more support vectors ν ν ν\nAs for the kernel functions of the SVR model, the types of kernel functions provided are the same to that of SVM; LINEAR, POLY, RBF, and SIGMOID which can be selected in the Kernel Type option.\nDepending on the type of kernel selected, there are different options that need to be set.\n\n(1) LINEAR kernel\n\nIt is the simplest kernel function that represents the dot product of two vectors in the input space. No options need to be set.\n\n(2) POLY (polynomial) kernel:\n\nIt represents the similarity of vectors in a polynomial feature space. Degree: flexibility of the decision boundary Gamma: scaling factor Ceof0: constant term that shifts the boundary\n\n(3) RBF kernel\n\nThe Gaussian kernel maps the data into an infinite-dimensional space. Gamma: width of the Gaussian function\n\n(4) SIGMOID kernel\n\nIt is similar to a neural network’s activation function. Gamma: scaling factor Coef0: constant term that shifts the boundary",

This is because specificity and sensitivity are the same for all classification criteria, so the frequency of diagonal elements in the misclassification matrix is the same as the frequency of off-diagonal elements.\n\n[Image:rId616]",
