The one is 2-Level Factorial Design and the other is the General Full Factorial Design. 2-Level Factorial Design refers to an experiment with 2-level factors. However, even if each factor has two level values, if the experiment is performed at all grid points, (n is the number of factors) experiments must be performed. Therefore, 2-Level Factorial Design provides a way to reduce the number of such experiments to suit your purposes. There are three types of 2-Level Factorial Design provided by ECMiner™ as follows.2 n\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators)\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators)\n\nPlackett-Burman Design\n\nECMiner™ provides the General Full Factorial Design, which is convenient when the number of levels for each factor is different. In this experiment, because the experiment is performed at all grid points, the significance level of all interactions can be determined.\n\n6.1.3.1.1. 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators)\n\n2-level fractional design (default generators) are used for full factorial and fractional factorial design.\nSelect 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators) as follows.\n[image:rId15] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" screen in ECMiner, where users can choose between Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design for experimental planning.\n\n[Table:t63]\n\n[Image:rId15] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" screen in ECMiner, where users can choose between Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design for experimental planning.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\nDefine factor name and enter values for the low and high levels. Set the number of responses and the name of each response value.\n\n[image:rId16] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify factors like reaction time, temperature, and ingredient amount with their respective low and high values for analysis.\n\n[Image:rId16] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify factors like reaction time, temperature, and ingredient amount with their respective low and high values for analysis.\n\nBy clicking the Available Design Chart(s) button, you can see the following screen.\n\n[image:rId17] The image is a design chart for ECMiner, showing factor turns and their corresponding levels in a grid format.\n\n[Image:rId17] The image is a design chart for ECMiner, showing factor turns and their corresponding levels in a grid format.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\nSelect fractional factorial design or full factorial design. Set the number of center points, the number of setup repetitions, and number of blocks.\n\nNumber of Center Points: Assume a linear relationship between factors and the response in a 2-level factorial design. Add center points to test for non-linear (curved) relationships. Set the center points to the midpoint of each factor in a 2-level factorial design.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Factor A: Low = 50, High = 100 Center = 75. →\n\n-Factor B: Low = 10, High = 20 Center = 15. →\n\n-Number of Replicates: Calculate the amount of pure error by repeating the same experiment.\n\n-Number of blocks: Set blocks in factorial design. Use blocking to reduce the impact of nuisance factors (uncontrolled variables) on the experimental results.\n\n[image:rId18] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 4 factors at 3 levels each, including center points and replicates.\n\n[Image:rId18] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 4 factors at 3 levels each, including center points and replicates.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\nDesign table is generated from design settings.

In response optimizer, an optimization algorithm is performed to obtain the response value desired by the user. The following are the plots by 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\nMain Effect Plot\n\nInteraction Plot\n\nSurface Plot\n\nContour Plot\n\nFor the main effect plot and interaction plot, first select whether to use the data average or the fitted average. And through the Setting button, you can select which factors to plot for.\n\nFor a surface plot and contour plot, you must enter a fixed value for one or more factors when there are three or more factors. Here's an example screen you'll get after making these settings.\n\n[Table:t124]\n\n[Image:rId32] The image shows an output results window in ECMiner with a surface plot displaying the relationship between two variables, highlighting interaction effects.\n\n[Image:rId33] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a Contour Plot with Reaction Temperature on the y-axis and Response Time on the x-axis, illustrating the relationship between these variables.\n\n[Image:rId30] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying the main effect plot for response time, temperature, and ingredient count on y1.\n\n[Image:rId31] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying graphs for response time and reaction temperature in relation to ingredient levels, illustrating how these factors affect the response time under different conditions.\n\nResponse Optimizer helps identify the combination of factor settings that optimize the response.

It displays various factors like Response Time, Reaction Temperature, and Amount of Ingredients, along with their corresponding values and overall desirability scores.\n\n[Image:rId35] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner for an Experimental Design using a 2-Level Factorial Design with Response Optimizer results. It displays various factors like Response Time, Reaction Temperature, and Amount of Ingredients, along with their corresponding values and overall desirability scores.\n\nFrom the above process, you can find out how to determine the level of each factor (Response Time, Response Temperature, Amount) in order to maximize the response value (yield). (At this time, the level of each factor is displayed in coded units.)\n\n6.1.3.1.2. 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators)\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators) allows to manually define and create a custom factorial design by specifying its factors, levels, and interactions.\nThis design works when the default designs (e.g., full factorial or fractional factorial) are not appropriate for a specific experimental with specific factor combinations or constraints.\nSelect 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators).\n[image:rId36] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like factorial design, response surface design, mixture design, and Taguchi design.\nStep 1, enter the number of factors before increasing the design using the design generators. In the above setting, the number of factors is set to 2. Step 2 screen is as follows.\n[image:rId37] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify options for completing a design table with 4 runs, full factorial analysis, k(2) p(0) resolution, 1 replicate, and 1 center point.\nClick the Constructor Design to increase number of factors and complete the part corresponding to the design generators. You can enter block generators depending on your experiment. For example, if you want to increase the number of factors using the generator C=AB, enter C as the left term and AB as the right term as shown above and click the next button.\n[image:rId38] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 4 factors at two levels each, including center points and replicates.\n[image:rId39] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) screen where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors and levels.\nYou can see that one more column corresponding to factor C has been created, and the value of this column is the same as the product of the value in Column A and the value in Column B. In this way, you can create design tables using different generators depending on your needs. The analysis process after this is the same as that of 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\n[Image:rId36] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like factorial design, response surface design, mixture design, and Taguchi design.\n\n[Image:rId37] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify options for completing a design table with 4 runs, full factorial analysis, k(2) p(0) resolution, 1 replicate, and 1 center point.\n\n[Image:rId38] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 4 factors at two levels each, including center points and replicates.\n\n[Image:rId39] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) screen where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors and levels.\n\n6.1.3.1.3. Plackett-Burman Design\n\nThis design is used when the number of factors is large. This design can be used when the user has prior knowledge that the only one factor the response value is the main effect. This prior knowledge helps to dramatically reduce the number of experiments.\nPlackett-Burman design has similar post-analysis steps to 2-Level Factorial Design. Therefore, we will mainly explain the differences compared to 2-Level Factorial Design.\nThe characteristic of Plackett-Burman is that it dramatically reduces the number of experiments when the experimenter knows in advance that there is only a linear relationship between factors and response values. For example, the main effect can be detected with just 48 experiments for 47 factors. The reason we use the Plackett-Burman design is that it can dramatically reduce the need for experimentation.\nSelect Plackett-Burman design and select 20 factors on the Step 1 screen. Step 2 Afterwards, if you move to the Step 2 screen, you can select the following number of experiments.\n[image:rId40] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMinerDOE software, where users specify design parameters like number of runs, center points, and repetitions for experimental design analysis.\nIf the experimenter aims to minimize the number of experiments, a design with 24 runs can be selected. The maximum number of runs can be selected up to 48, but 48 experiments for 20 is not particularly burdensome. Set the number of runs and the number of center points and repetition according to your purpose. Center point is used to check curvature, and by increasing repetition, pure error can be checked how much the difference in response value occurs at the same experimental point.\nIn Step 3, the design table is completed, and in Step 4, the following screen appears.\n[image:rId41] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner software, where users can configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and start the analysis process.\nIn the Plackett-Burman design, interactions other than the main effect cannot be detected. If you select a factor and proceed with analysis, the subsequent process is the same as 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\n[Image:rId40] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMinerDOE software, where users specify design parameters like number of runs, center points, and repetitions for experimental design analysis.\n\n[Image:rId41] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner software, where users can configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and start the analysis process.\n\n6.1.3.1.4. General Full Factorial Design\n\nGeneral Full Factorial Design overcomes the limitation that the previous three designs (2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators), 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators), and Plackett-Burman Design) can only conduct 2-level experiments. DOE is capable of. The level of each factor can have any value. For example, when the number of factors is 3, the number of levels can be 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In General, Full Factorial Design, all possible combinations are tested, so if the number of levels is 2, 3, or 4, you will get the following design table.\nThe following is a Full Factorial Design\n\n[Table:t172]\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId42] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\n[Image:rId42] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\nIf there are three factors (A, B, C) that can have values of 2-Level, 3-Level, and 4-Level, respectively, enter the setting values as above.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId43] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users specify options for completing a design table with factors/levels, repetitions, and block designation.\n\n[Image:rId43] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users specify options for completing a design table with factors/levels, repetitions, and block designation.\n\nIn Design Selection window you determine the number of repetitions and whether you want to assign blocks to repetitions.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId44] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) table where users can input design parameters, analyze results, and optimize plots for data mining analysis.\n\n[Image:rId44] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) table where users can input design parameters, analyze results, and optimize plots for data mining analysis.\n\nAfter the table is created, enter the response value y1 and click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId45] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and highest-order interactions before starting the analysis.\n\n[Image:rId45] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and highest-order interactions before starting the analysis.\n\nSet the Highest-order interaction to 3 and start the analysis. When you start analysis after completing settings, the following results screen will appear.\n\n[image:rId46] The image shows an ANOVA table for response value y1 in ECMiner, analyzing variability in terms A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, and ABC with their respective degrees of freedom, mean sum of squares, F-values, and p-values.\n\n[Image:rId46] The image shows an ANOVA table for response value y1 in ECMiner, analyzing variability in terms A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, and ABC with their respective degrees of freedom, mean sum of squares, F-values, and p-values.\n\nGeneral Info, residual analysis and interpretation of other information are the same as 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators). The ANOVA table shows that the variance increases significantly when the degree of interaction is high. In this case, it is difficult to explain the response value with only the individual effects of A, B, and C, and the response value y1 is determined by complex effects.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nMain effect plot and interaction plot. (Surface plot, contour plot, and response optimizer functions are not provided.) Main effect plot and interaction plot, shows how the value y1 reacts according to each level of the factor.\n\n[image:rId47] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a main effect plot with three variables A, B, and C, illustrating their individual effects on a dependent variable y1.\n\n[Image:rId47] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a main effect plot with three variables A, B, and C, illustrating their individual effects on a dependent variable y1.\n\n[image:rId48] The image shows output results from ECMiner, displaying main effect plots for variables A and B with different levels of factors A and B.\n\n[Image:rId48] The image shows output results from ECMiner, displaying main effect plots for variables A and B with different levels of factors A and B.",

At this time, if the temperature and time are and the reaction amount is y, will have a relationship of x1, x2\n\ny=f x1, x2\n\nResponse Surface Design allows the experimenter to identify the relationship between factors and responses with a small number of experiments when the experimenter has some prior knowledge about the factors and responses.

    "Context": "This content is about the section Extension, and more specifically it belongs to DOE, under the subsection DOE Method s, with a detailed reference to Central Composite Design.\n\nFor a quadratic regression model with k number of independent variables,\n\ny= β0 + i=1 k β i x i + i≤j k β ij x i x j +ϵ ϵ~N(0, σ2)\n\nthe regression coefficient cannot be estimated using the 2-Level factor placement method. Because in a 2-level factorial experiment, the experiment is conducted only at two levels of each variable, it is not possible to detect the curved change in the response amount that occurs according to the change in the level of the variable, and it is impossible to estimate the coefficient of the square term in the quadratic regression model. In order to compensate for these shortcomings and estimate the curved surface with a small number of experiments, the DOE in which the center point and axis point are added to the 2-Level factor experiment as follows is called Central Composite Design.\nIn Central Composite Design, the number of center points is not limited and can be at least one, and the number of axis points is 2k. Here, the value of k can be a positive number. For example, if the factor is 3 and there are two central points, the central composite design in Full factorial design is as follows.\n[image:rId49] The image shows an ECMiner matrix with alternating signs in rows and columns, representing a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements being negative and off-diagonal elements being positive.\nLines 1 to 8 are experiments on grid points. And lines 9 to 14 are the axis points. And the last two rows are the center points. This will result in a design that can sufficiently estimate the regression equation for the quadratic curve. This type of experimental design has the advantage of being able to find the regression equation for the quadratic curve with a much smaller number of experiments than 3-Level Factorial Design.\nThe number of experiments in this experiment is\n\n[Image:rId49] The image shows an ECMiner matrix with alternating signs in rows and columns, representing a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements being negative and off-diagonal elements being positive.\n\nn= 2 k +2 k+ n0, n0 is a number of center points.\n\nAn advantage of Central Composite Design is its flexibility for sequential experiments. For instance, if a 2-Level Factorial Design with a first-order regression model proves inadequate, additional design points can be added to the center and axes to convert it into a Central Composite Design, without having to start a new DOE.\nSelect Central Composite Design from Response Surface Design.\n[image:rId50] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Central Composite Design, Box-Behnken Design, and 2-Level Design for data mining and analysis.\n\n[Table:t226]\n\n[Image:rId50] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Central Composite Design, Box-Behnken Design, and 2-Level Design for data mining and analysis.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\nFirst, name the factors as ‘G300 Amount’ and ‘V130 Amount,’ keeping their low and high units as initially defined.

In a usable design, ‘complete’ means that the grid points contain all the points in the 2-Level Full factorial design, and ‘partial’ means that the grid points contain the points in the 2-Level Fractional factorial design.\n\n-Center Point Count: Enter default or custom values.\n\n-Repetition Count: The default repetition count is 1, but the user can enter the repetition count arbitrarily. Blocks can also be assigned to repetition as needed.\n\n-Alpha value: Use the default value, Face Centered (Alpha value = 1), or enter a custom value.\n\nSince we want to conduct the experiment three times at each factor point, axis point, and center point, set the center point count to 1, alpha value to 1 (Face Centered), and repetition count to 3, as shown in the following screen, and click the next button.\n\n[image:rId52] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including runs, blocks, total runs, cube axis, alpha default value, center point count, repetition count, and alpha value settings.\n\n[Image:rId52] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including runs, blocks, total runs, cube axis, alpha default value, center point count, repetition count, and alpha value settings.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\nAt this stage, the design table is completed from the settings of Step 1 and Step 2. Through experiment, enter response values corresponding to adhesion, modulus, and elongation in the completed design table.

adhesion.\n\nFor detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn this step, you can draw a surface plot and contour plot with the Regression Model created in Step 4 and optimize the response according to the user's purpose. Since there are currently two factors, there is no need to enter a separate fixed value. The surface plot and contour plot according to each response value are as follows.\n\nSurface plot, contour plot for response value “Adhesion”\n\n[Table:t297]\n\n[Image:rId72] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three dimensions representing adhesion, modulus, and elongation values.\n\n[Image:rId73] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying contour plots for surface adhesion, modulus, and elongation metrics across different V1.30 and G300 amounts.\n\nSurface plot, contour plot for response value “Modulus”\n\n[Table:t300]\n\n[Image:rId74] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three different plots: adhesion, modulus, and elongation, illustrating how these properties vary across different parameters.\n\n[Image:rId75] The image shows an output from ECMiner, displaying a contour plot with values for V130 Amount and G300 Amount, illustrating relationships between variables in a surface plot format.\n\nSurface plot, contour plot for response value \"Elongation”\n\n[Table:t303]\n\n[Image:rId76] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three axes representing adhesion, modulus, and elongation, illustrating how these properties vary across different values.\n\n[Image:rId77] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying contour plots for surface adhesion, modulus, and elongation, with values labeled on the graph.\n\nIn this experiment, the experimenter's goal is to maximize the modulus value over 145, the elongation value over 388, and the adhesion value. To do this, set the following settings.\n\n[image:rId78] The image shows the Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner, where users can set response values for adhesion, modulus, and elongation with specified limits and weights.\n\n[Image:rId78] The image shows the Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner, where users can set response values for adhesion, modulus, and elongation with specified limits and weights.\n\nIn the window above, the target values of modulus and elongation are set to 145 and 388, it means that there is no need to increase the values any more, once these values are reached. And the reason why the target value of adhesion was set as large as possible is because in the case of adhesion, the larger the better. (In fact, it seems reasonable to set the lower limit of modulus and elongation to 145 and 388. However, in this case, if the modulus value is less than 145 or the elongation value is less than 388, the desirability function becomes 0. In fact, this area is so large that it is often difficult to find the optimal value when performing optimization. For this purpose, the performance of optimization was improved by setting the lower limit a little smaller.)\n\nAfter configuring this and performing optimization, you can get the following results.\n\n[image:rId79] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner software, displaying experimental design response surface optimization for a central composite design with coded units and uncoded units.\n\n[Image:rId79] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner software, displaying experimental design response surface optimization for a central composite design with coded units and uncoded units.\n\nFrom this, we can see that if the G300 content is -1.414 and the V130 content is 0.211, the adhesion can be maximized to 73.652 while satisfying the conditions of modulus and elongation.\n\n6.1.3.2.2. Box-Behnken Design\n\nBox Behnken's design was created to complement the shortcomings of 2-Level design and 3-Level design. In general, p-level designs are suitable for polynomial fits of order p-1. Therefore, it is difficult to fit a second order polynomial with a 2-level design, and although it is possible with a 3-level design, it has the disadvantage of requiring a large number of experiments. Box Behnken's design is an experiment that selects a part of the 3-level design and allows for more efficient second order polynomial fit.\nBox Behnken design is also a design created for the same purpose as central composite design. Therefore, rather than explaining this in detail with an example, we will explain the differences in central composite design. (For basic methods of Response Surface Design, please refer to 6.1.3.2.2. Central composite design.)\nSelect Box Behnken Design from Response Surface Design. In the Step 1 screen, enter the number of factors, factor name, and upper and lower limits, and enter the number of response values and names according to the response value.\nThe screen for Step 2 is as follows.\n[image:rId80] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users can specify design parameters like center point count, repetition count, and block count for experimental design analysis.\nAs shown, simply select the options, and the subsequent process will be the same as central composite design.\n\n[Image:rId80] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users can specify design parameters like center point count, repetition count, and block count for experimental design analysis.\n\n6.1.3.2.3. Response Surface Design D Optimal Design\n\nD-Optimal Design is a method that adjusts the experimental design to best suit future statistical analysis, allowing customization based on the user's needs. There are the following indicators to judge the excellence of design.",

This design can be said to be suitable for the following polynomial.2 q -1\n\nη= 1 q β i x i + i<j q β ij x i x j + i<j<k q β ijk x i x j x k +…+ β12…q x1 x2 … x q\n\nFrom this, we can see that as the number of components increases, the degree of the appropriate polynomial also increases.\nTo perform Simplex Center Design, select Mixture Design -> Simplex Center Design on the following screen.\n[image:rId82] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\n[Table:t382]\n\n[Image:rId82] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId83] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for data analysis.\n\n[Image:rId83] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for data analysis.\n\nIn this screen, the number of components is 3, the number of response values is 1, and the name of the response value is firmness. The options that appear on this screen are explained as follows.\n\n-Single Total: Specifies the sum of each component. The default value is 1.\n\n-Multiple Total: Enter the values for the mixture amount design. All values must be positive numbers and should be separated by spaces.\n\n-Add Process Variable: Use when adding a Process Variable to Mixture Design.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId84] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including axis points, center points, vertices, and mixed designs.\n\n[Image:rId84] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including axis points, center points, vertices, and mixed designs.\n\nOn this screen, set several options to confirm the design.\n\nExpand Design by Adding Axis Points\n\nAdds axis points between the center point and the points corresponding to each vertex.\n\nRepetition Setting\n\n-Specify Iteration Count for Entire Design: Specify how many times to repeat the design table created through this option.\n\n-Specify Iteration Count for Selected Design Point: This option allows the user to set the number of repetitions depending on the point type.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId85] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors A, B, C, and D.\n\n[Image:rId85] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors A, B, C, and D.\n\nAt this stage, the design table is completed, and the experimenter conducts the experiment according to the created table and inputs the resulting response values. This completes everything you need for analysis. Click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId86] The image shows a simplex chart in ECMiner, displaying three vertices A, B, and C with corresponding coordinates for data analysis.\n\n[Image:rId86] The image shows a simplex chart in ECMiner, displaying three vertices A, B, and C with corresponding coordinates for data analysis.\n\nBefore making analysis-related settings, you can use the Simplex Design plot to see how the design points created in the design table are arranged. The simplex design plot above shows that the points are evenly spaced\n\n[image:rId87] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type for mixture components.\n\n[Image:rId87] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type for mixture components.\n\nSet the model in the main screen of Step 4 and start the analysis. This allows regression analysis, analysis of variance, and residual analysis. If you made a prediction on the main screen in Step 4, you can also see the predicted value.\n\nGeneral Info: Shows general information about the design.\n\nModel Info: View results of regression analysis, ANOVA, and unusual observations (extreme leverage, standardized residuals).\n\n[image:rId88] The image shows the results of an experimental design using a Simplex Center Design in ECMiner, analyzing response values Y1 with coefficients for terms A, B, C, and their interactions.\n\n[Image:rId88] The image shows the results of an experimental design using a Simplex Center Design in ECMiner, analyzing response values Y1 with coefficients for terms A, B, C, and their interactions.\n\nRegression analysis and analysis of variance shows that the model has high suitability, and residual analysis below shows that the normality assumption is reasonable.\n\nResidual-related plots: View residual histograms, residual normal probability plots, residuals versus ordinal, and residuals versus fitted values.\n\n[Table:t423]\n\n[Image:rId90] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. z-value plot for model diagnostics. The red dots represent residuals, while the line represents the fitted values.\n\n[Image:rId91] The image shows a residual vs. fitted values plot in ECMiner, used to evaluate model fit and identify potential outliers.\n\n[Image:rId92] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying residual plots with UCL and LCL lines for model evaluation.\n\n[Image:rId89] The image shows an output results window in ECMiner, displaying a residual histogram for model y1, illustrating residuals' distribution across different ranges.\n\nOther Information\n\nShows residual related statistics.\n\n[image:rId93] The image shows output results from an Experimental Design using a Mixture Design with a Simplex Center Design, focusing on fitted values, residuals, and other statistical measures for response value y1.\n\n[Image:rId93] The image shows output results from an Experimental Design using a Mixture Design with a Simplex Center Design, focusing on fitted values, residuals, and other statistical measures for response value y1.\n\nFor detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nThrough Step 5 of Mixture Design, you can view surface plots and contour plots, and perform response optimizer tailored to the user's purpose. Below are the surface plot and contour plot for the Regression Model created in Step 4.\n\n[Table:t432]\n\n[Image:rId95] The image shows an output results window with a contour plot displaying the relationship between variables A, B, and C on a surface plot.\n\n[Image:rId94] The image shows an output results window in ECMiner with a Surface Plot displaying a 3D graph representing data points on a surface.\n\nIf the purpose of this experiment is to know which combination of ingredients maximizes the response value (firmness), enter the following in the setting window. Setting the lower limit at -1 means that any response value below -1 is considered equally 'not good.' The target value is set at a very large value, such as 1000, to indicate that we want to maximize the response value as much as possible.\n\n[image:rId96] The image is a screenshot of the Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner, showing options for setting response objectives, limits, weights, and importance levels. It also displays graphs illustrating how different objective functions influence desirability curves.\n\n[Image:rId96] The image is a screenshot of the Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner, showing options for setting response objectives, limits, weights, and importance levels. It also displays graphs illustrating how different objective functions influence desirability curves.\n\nAfter making the settings as above and completing the simple option settings, click View Results and you will get the following results.\n\n[image:rId97] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design with Simplex Center Design in ECMiner, displaying response optimizer data for three runs with overall desirability values.\n\n[Image:rId97] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design with Simplex Center Design in ECMiner, displaying response optimizer data for three runs with overall desirability values.\n\nIn other words, through response optimizer, it can be seen that the firmness value increases to 6.52244 when component A is 0.00044, component B is 0.00104, and component C is 0.99853. The experimenter checks whether the firmness value increases to a satisfactory level in this combination of components. You can end the experiment or resume the experiment.\n\n6.1.3.3.2. Simplex Lattice Design\n\nIf the goal is to conduct an experiment in a simplex region and create a regression model based on the experiment results, it would be desirable for the experiment points to be evenly distributed throughout the simplex region. The design that meets this purpose is Simplex Lattice Design. Simplex Lattice Design is a useful design for fitting m-order polynomials when there are n components.\nThrough Simplex Lattice Design, we will explain mixture volume design. First, select Simplex Lattice Design.\n[image:rId98] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\n[Table:t445]\n\n[Image:rId98] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId99] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for data mining analysis.\n\n[Image:rId99] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for data mining analysis.\n\nIn this step, we set up the basic settings for the ingredients used in the experiment. Since this experiment is a mixture amount design, multiple total amounts are selected rather than a single total. If you think the quantity will have a quadratic or greater impact on the response value, experiment with three or more positive values. If you are sure that the quantity will have a linear effect on the response value, two quantity values are sufficient. This requires careful consideration because the smaller the number of positive values, the fewer the number of experiments.\n\nHowever, as a result of the analysis of the first experiment conducted in this way, if it is confirmed that the effect of the amount of mixture is quadratic or higher, there is no need to perform the experiment perfectly from the beginning, as you only need to do a few additional experiments. After completing the settings, click the Next button to proceed to the next screen.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId100] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including grid size, center points, and axis points.\n\n[Image:rId100] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including grid size, center points, and axis points.\n\nIn this step, several detailed options are set to complete the design.\n\nGrid: It is very important how you select this grid because the degree of model that can be suitable is determined depending on the grid. If you want to do the first fit, you need to set the grid to 1 or higher, and if you want to do the second fit, you need to set the grid to 2 or more. Since the current composition is expected to have a secondary effect on the strength of the metal, the grid is set to 3 to allow some margin. (As the number of Grids increases, the number of experiments increases, so be sure to keep this in mind when choosing options.)\n\nFor repeat settings, it is the same as Simplex Center Design.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId101] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors and levels.\n\n[Image:rId101] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for factors and levels.\n\nThrough Step 3, the Design Table is completed, and the experimenter performs the experiment according to the given Design Table and then inputs the response value (strength). After completing your input, click the Next button to proceed to the analysis step.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId102] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type for mixture quantity experiments. In Step 4, you can select Mixture Quantity Experiment in Model Type. If mixture components are selected, even if the amounts are different, if the proportions are the same, they are considered the same and analyzed. However, since it is clear that the actual experiment given here is one that requires consideration of the amount of mixture, we choose the experiment of amount of mixture. The maximum order of the term to be included and the maximum order of both terms of the mixture to be included are set to quadratic and linear, respectively, and terms that are known in advance to have no effect are removed as above. (Alternatively, it is a good idea to analyze by including all possible terms and then look at the analysis results and remove terms that are deemed meaningless.) The analysis details are 6.1.3.3.1. Please refer to Simplex Center Design.\n\n[Image:rId102] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type for mixture quantity experiments.\n\nHowever, the Regression Model created above has the following form.\n\ny= b1 x1 + b2 x2 + b3 x3 + b12 x1 x2 + b13 x1 x3 + b23 x2 x3 + b1,Amount x1 Amount-A + b2, Amount Amount-A + b3, Amount Amount-A\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn this step, the regression model created in Step 4 is expressed as a surface plot and contour plot, and a response optimizer function is provided to meet the experimenter's purpose. When the amount of mixture is 2, the plot looks like this.\n\n[Table:t475]\n\n[Image:rId103] The image shows an output result from ECMiner software displaying a surface plot with variables A, B, and C, illustrating the relationship between these factors on a continuous scale.\n\n[Image:rId104] The image shows an output results window with a Contour Plot displaying surface data for variables A, B, and C, indicating different values at various points in the space.\n\nThe experimenter's goal is to maximize the response value (strength), so the goal is maximization and the lower limit and target values are entered as appropriate values. Again, for the same reason as in most examples, we set the lower limit to -1 and the upper limit to 1000.\n\n[image:rId105] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design with Simplex Lattice Design in ECMiner, displaying response optimizer data for three runs with various parameters and overall desirability scores.\n\n[Image:rId105] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design with Simplex Lattice Design in ECMiner, displaying response optimizer data for three runs with various parameters and overall desirability scores.\n\nFrom the above results, we can see that the maximum strength of the metal can be obtained at (A, B, C) = 3*(0, 0, 1).\n\n6.1.3.3.3. Vertex Design\n\nVertex Design refers to finding the vertices of the Convex Set that satisfy the upper and lower limit conditions and linear constraints when these conditions are added, augmenting the experiment with these vertices, and then performing experiments on these points. Intuitively, we can see that when there are only upper and lower limit conditions and linear constraints in an n-dimensional space, it is not an easy process to find the vertices of the space created by these conditions. Therefore, this cannot be obtained through a simple process, but Piepel (1988) presented an algorithm to obtain these vertices.\nWe will explain how to add process variables to Mixture Design through Vertex Design.\nFirst, select Vertex Design.\n[image:rId106] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\n[Table:t486]\n\n[Image:rId106] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs for experimental planning.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\nFirst, add a process variable by selecting the Add Process Variable checkbox. Then click Setting button to view the pop-up window as shown below.\n\n[image:rId107] The image shows the \"Process Variables\" window in ECMiner, where users can select process variables for a full factorial design with one variable ranging from 100 to 200.\n\n[Image:rId107] The image shows the \"Process Variables\" window in ECMiner, where users can select process variables for a full factorial design with one variable ranging from 100 to 200.\n\nThen, enter the constraints for the ingredients in the main screen of Step 1 and click the Next button.\n\n[image:rId108] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for feature selection and analysis.\n\n[Image:rId108] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, their levels, and response values for feature selection and analysis.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId109] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including adding center points and axis points, with repetition settings for each point type.\n\n[Image:rId109] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments, including adding center points and axis points, with repetition settings for each point type.\n\nSeveral options can be specified in the Design selection step.\n\nDesign order: Take the current vertex and decide to what degree the point should be augmented.\n\nExpand Design by Adding Center Point: Determine whether to add a center point\n\nExpand Design by Adding Axis Points: Determine whether to add an axis point, which is the midpoint between the center point and each vertex\n\nRepetition Setting\n\n-Specify iteration Count for Entire Design: Specifies how many times to repeat the same entire experiment\n\n-Specify iteration Count for Selected Design Point: Depending on the type of point, the number of repetitions varies.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId110] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for various factors and levels.\n\n[Image:rId110] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for various factors and levels.\n\nAt the Design Table stage, a Design Table is created, the experimenter conducts an experiment according to the created design, and then inputs the response values. After completing the input, click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\nBefore starting Analysis Result, check how the design points created through the current algorithm are distributed in space through a Simplex Design plot.\n\n[image:rId111] The image shows a simplex chart in ECMiner, displaying data points on a triangular grid with coordinates A, B, and C, used for visualizing and analyzing multi-dimensional data.\n\n[Image:rId111] The image shows a simplex chart in ECMiner, displaying data points on a triangular grid with coordinates A, B, and C, used for visualizing and analyzing multi-dimensional data.\n\nAlthough the arrangement of the design points is not triangular due to the limiting conditions, they are arranged evenly in the limited space.\n\n[image:rId112] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type before starting the analysis.\n\n[Image:rId112] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMiner software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis, select response variables, available factors, and model type before starting the analysis.\n\nFor Model Type, select Add process variable and enter the maximum order of terms to include and the maximum order of the process variable terms to be included as required. Then you can get the following result:\n\nGeneral Info: Provides basic information about design.\n\nModel Info: Provides information on regression, analysis of variance, and unusual observations (extreme leverage, standardized residuals).\n\n[image:rId113] The image shows the results of an experimental design analysis using Mixture Design: Vertex Design in ECMiner software, focusing on response value y1 with various coefficients and their significance levels.\n\n[Image:rId113] The image shows the results of an experimental design analysis using Mixture Design: Vertex Design in ECMiner software, focusing on response value y1 with various coefficients and their significance levels.\n\nResidual related (residual histogram, residual normal probability plot, residual vs. ordered, residual vs. fitted Value)\n\n[Table:t528]\n\n[Image:rId117] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying residual plots with various lines indicating model fit and residuals for different runs.\n\n[Image:rId114] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual histogram with various ranges and their corresponding residuals, used for model diagnostics.\n\n[Image:rId115] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. fitted values plot with a linear trend line, indicating model fit analysis.\n\n[Image:rId116] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner data mining software, displaying a residual vs. fitted values plot with various lines and markers indicating model diagnostics.\n\nOther Information\n\norganize and displays other residual-related information.\n\n[image:rId118] The image shows output results from an Experimental Design using a Mixture Design with Vertex Design, focusing on fitted values, residuals, and other statistical measures for response value y1.\n\n[Image:rId118] The image shows output results from an Experimental Design using a Mixture Design with Vertex Design, focusing on fitted values, residuals, and other statistical measures for response value y1.\n\nFor more information, see 6.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn the Step 5, it shows what the Regression Model created in Step 4 looks like through surface plots and contour plots.\n\n[Table:t537]\n\n[Image:rId119] The image shows an output results window in ECMiner with a surface plot displaying the relationship between variables A, B, and C, highlighting the maximum value at point A.\n\n[Image:rId120] The image shows an output results window with a Surface Plot displaying the relationship between variables A, B, and C on a contour plot.\n\nResponse optimizer is performed according to the experimenter's objectives. The goal of the current experiment is to maximize quality, so if the goal is maximized and the optimization is performed with the lower limit and target value as -1 and 1000, respectively, the following results can be obtained.\n\n[image:rId121] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design and Vertex Design in ECMiner, focusing on Response Optimizer with three runs and their respective coefficients and overall desirability scores.\n\n[Image:rId121] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design and Vertex Design in ECMiner, focusing on Response Optimizer with three runs and their respective coefficients and overall desirability scores.\n\nIn other words, you can see that the maximum quality of 36.05873 can be obtained when Components (A, B, C) = (0.5, 0, 0.5) and Process Variable = 1 (working temperature = 100 degrees).\n\n6.1.3.3.4. Mixture Design and D Optimal Design\n\nMixture Design and D Optimal Design is a method that optimizes the design for the best process (e.g., food ingredients, chemical blends, or formulations). D-Optimal Mixture Design combines the principles of mixture designs and D-optimality to create an efficient experimental plan for mixture experiments.",

    "Context": "This content is about the section Extension, and more specifically it belongs to DOE, under the subsection DOE Method s, with a detailed reference to Taguchi Design.\n\nThe Taguchi design of experiment has several roles, especially as an expanded one compared to the conventional design of experiment.\nPreviously, it was difficult to evaluate the degree of influence on data by causes such as uncontrollable environmental conditions, difficult-to-control production conditions, and process conditions (these are collectively referred to as noise factors), but it is gradually becoming possible to evaluate this objectively and quantitatively. In Taguchi's experimental design, this is evaluated using the SNR. In other words, the Taguchi experiment plan finds the optimal experiment combination that can reach the operator's desired conditions in an experiment environment that includes noise. Additionally, the number of experiments is dramatically reduced through the use of orthogonal array tables.\nIn addition to the above features, the Taguchi design has many advantages. The Taguchi method provided by ECMiner TM DOE is as follows:\n\n2- Level Design\n\n3- Level Design\n\n4- Level Design\n\n5- Level Design\n\nMix-Level Design\n\n6.1.3.4.1. 2- Level Design\n\n2-Level Design is a design used when there are two levels per factor. It is said that there is an experiment as follows.\nSelect Taguchi 2-Level Design.\n[image:rId124] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs.\n\n[Table:t604]\n\n[Image:rId124] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId125] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify factors, levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\n[Image:rId125] The image shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner software, where users specify factors, levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\nSelect 7 factors and select 3 as the number of response values. In this case, the number of response values 3 means three types of roads.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId126] The image shows the \"Design selection\" window in ECMiner, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 2-level factors.\n\n[Image:rId126] The image shows the \"Design selection\" window in ECMiner, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 2-level factors.\n\nThere are many designs to choose from, of which we choose the L8 design, which has the fewest number of experiments.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId127] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for various factors and levels.\n\n[Image:rId127] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) window where users can complete a design table by entering response values for various factors and levels.\n\nEnter the amount of CO from the three types of roads in the completed Design Table. The values entered in this way will be used for later statistical analysis.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId128] The image shows the output results for an Experimental Design using Taguchi Design in ECMiner, detailing factors A, B, and C with their respective levels and level names.\n\n[Image:rId128] The image shows the output results for an Experimental Design using Taguchi Design in ECMiner, detailing factors A, B, and C with their respective levels and level names.\n\nSince a smaller the current CO value is better, select the Mesh characteristic and start the analysis. As a result of the analysis, you can obtain a variance analysis table along with the SN ratio Factors with a negligible small SS can be excluded from the initial experiment. Since the SS of E is substantially large, this factor is considered a decisive factor in the SN ratio of CO.\n\nFor a detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\n[image:rId129] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying main effect plots for average and standard deviation values across different categories. At this stage, the optimal conditions can be found through the main effects plot for the SN ratio. Since a larger SN ratio is better, the optimal conditions are A2, B2, C1, D2, E2, F1, and G2.\n\n[Image:rId129] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying main effect plots for average and standard deviation values across different categories.\n\nHowever, if the levels of only a few factors can be determined, B and E should first be set to levels 1 for both factors. And for the remaining factors, the level is determined by considering economic and cost effectiveness.\n\nThe experimental plan is terminated after determining reproducibility at the optimally determined level through re-experimentation.\n\n6.1.3.4.2. 3- Level Design\n\n3-Level Design is a design used when there are three levels per factor. Suppose we have the following experiment.\nSelect Taguchi Design 3-Level Design.\n[image:rId130] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs.\n\n[Table:t635]\n\n[Image:rId130] The image shows the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, allowing users to choose between various experimental planning methods like Factorial, Response Surface, Mixture, and Taguchi designs.\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId131] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\n[Image:rId131] This screenshot shows the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, where users specify factors, levels, and response values for design experiments.\n\nName the factors as above, select 4 response values, and give them names appropriate for the level of each noise factor.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId132] The image shows the \"Design selection\" window in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 3-level factors.\n\n[Image:rId132] The image shows the \"Design selection\" window in ECMiner software, where users specify design options for factorial experiments with 3-level factors.\n\nThere are currently two designs to choose from, of which I choose the L9.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId133] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) window where users can input design table values for analysis and optimization.\n\n[Image:rId133] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) window where users can input design table values for analysis and optimization.\n\nOnce the design table is completed, enter the experimental characteristic values at each level of the non-controlling factors.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId134] The image shows an experimental design using Taguchi Design in ECMiner, detailing three factors with three levels each for bondizing ratio, bonding method, and surface treatment method.\n\n[Image:rId134] The image shows an experimental design using Taguchi Design in ECMiner, detailing three factors with three levels each for bondizing ratio, bonding method, and surface treatment method.\n\nSince the current characteristic value represents the content of impurities, a smaller value indicates better performance. So, select the mesh feature and start the analysis. The analysis of variance table based on the SN ratio shows that B's SS (Sum of Square) is extremely small. From this, we can see that factors A, C, and D all well explain the variance in SN ratio.\n\nFor detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\n[image:rId135] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying the main effect plot for average values across different mining methods and treatment methods.\n\n[Image:rId135] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying the main effect plot for average values across different mining methods and treatment methods.\n\nIn this step, the optimal experimental conditions can be found through the main effects plot for the SN ratio. Currently, the SN ratio is the highest for A at level 2, B at level 3, C at level 3, and D at level 3, so A1, B2, C1, and D1 are the best conditions, assuming there is no interaction between A, B, and C. We conduct a confirmation experiment to confirm reproducibility and complete the experiment.\n\n6.1.3.4.3. 4 - Level Design, 5- Level Design, Mix-Level Design\n\nThe analysis method of all Taguchi Designs is the same as 2 and 3-Level Design. Therefore, we will only mention the characteristics of 4-Level Design, 5-Level Design, and Mix-Level Design.\n\nA 4-Level Design is a design in which the number of factor levels is 4.\n\n5- Level Design\n\nA 5-Level Design is a design in which the number of factor levels is 5.\n\nMix-Level Design\n\nMix - Level Design is a design where the number of levels of a factor varies depending on the factor. ECMiner TM DOE offers a design.21 × 37\n\nFor detailed analysis methods, see 6.1.3.4.1. 2-Level Design, 6.1.3.4.2. 3-Level Design, 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.",

Dispersion Analysis (Analysis of Variance, ANOVA)\n\nAnalysis of Variance allows you to determine whether each term affects the response value by determining the degree of variance caused by each term in the total variance. Distributed Analysis can be easily performed through the Regressor Matrix used in regression analysis.\nFirst, if there is a block, we need to find the variance for the block.\nIf we call the Submatrix consist of Regressor Matrix X's first to ith Column as, and w hen the total number of blocks is bn (>=2) it is X i\n\nSum of squares of block= y T X bn X bn T X bn -1 X bn T -X1 X1 T X1 -1 X1 T y\n\nIf the number of blocks is 1, the above process is not executed. And the degree of freedom at this time is bn-1.\nNow we need to find the Sum of Squares for each term. One term corresponds to one column of X. If a term corresponds to the jth column, the sum of square of that term is\n\ny T X i X i T X i -1 X i -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nAt this time, the degree of freedom of this term is 1. However, ECMiner™ DOE does not calculate the Sum of Square for each term, but instead calculates the Sum of Square by grouping it by the main effect, two-way interaction, three-way interaction, or other characteristics. First, if the columns due to the main effect are from i to j, use the\n\ny T X j X j T X j -1 X j -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nformula to find the Sum of Square. This is ultimately equal to the sum of the Sum of Squares for each column that makes up the main effect. Its degrees of freedom are i -j. In the same way, k-way interactions are also grouped to obtain the Sum of Square.\nIf there is a center point in the design, the last column corresponds to it. The variation about the center point is called Curvature. When the number of columns of X is Ncols, it is\n\nSum of Squares of Curvature= y T X Ncols X Ncols T X Ncols -1 X Ncols T -X Ncols-1 X Ncols-1 T X Ncols-1 -1 X Ncols-1 y\n\nand the degree of freedom is 1.\nIn the case of SSE and SST, they are obtained as follows.\n\nSSE=SST- Sum of Squares of all items.\n\nSST= i=1 n y i -y2\n\nThe degree of freedom at this time is ‘total number of data – 1’. Blocks, Curvature, main effects, two-way interaction. The F value and P value of are obtained through\n\nF-value= SS/df SST/(n-1) p-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(df,n-1)\n\nAnother thing to consider is Lack of Fit. When we calculate SSE, it can be said that SSE consists of Pure Error and Lack of Fit. Pure Error can be obtained when experiments are conducted on the same point with multiple times (twice or more).\n(However, the same point here does not mean the actual same point. Here, the same point is said if the rows of the Regressor Matrix are the same. Even if the actual experimental points are different, the rows of the Regressor Matrix may be the same depending on how the selection term is selected.)\nIf ak (1<=k<=m) experiment point (when Nk experiments are performed) Pure Error is\n\nPure Error= k=1 m SST at a k\n\nwhere SST at a k = i∈A y i2 -N a k * i∈A y i N a k2 The set A consists of the rows of a k\n\nAnd the degrees of freedom of Pure Error are:\n\nDF of Pure Error= k=1 m (N a k -1)\n\nIf the Pure Error and its degrees of freedom are obtained in this way, the SS and degrees of freedom of the Lack of Fit can also be obtained as follows.\n\nSum of Squares of Lack of Fit'=SSE-Pure Error\n\nDF of Lack of Fit=DF of SSE-DF of Pure Error\n\nAt this time, the F value and P value of Lack of Fit obtained are\n\nFvalue= SS of Lack of Fit DF of Lack of Fit Pure Error DF of Pure Error and\n\np-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(DF of Lack of Fit, DF of Pure Error)\n\nThrough this, you can statistically check whether there is a lack of suitability of this model.",

Using the main effects plot, you can intuitively understand what the response value or the fitted value in a regression model is at a specific level. In factorial design, you can select the data mean (using the response value directly) or the fitted mean (using the fitted value from the Regression Model), and in the design with Process Variable added in Mixture Design, only the data mean can be used.\n[image:rId129] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying main effect plots for average and standard deviation values across different categories.\n\n6.1.4.3.2.

Then draw one line. When factor A is 1 and factor B is -1 another line is drawn by connecting the average of the response values of all experiments and the average of the response values (or fitted values) of all experiments when factor A is 1 and factor B is 1. If we draw this on one screen, we can see the interaction of the ABs.

This is because meaningful results can be obtained with just this regression model. To add a little more, residual analysis, analysis fo r variance, etc. are performed to determine the significance of the regression model. This somewhat concludes the DOE's process.\nHowever, for user convenience and ease of interpretation, a plot can be drawn to express the results more visually and intuitively. For this purpose, in case of factorial design, main effects plot, interaction plot, surface plot, and contour plot are provided, and in case of response surface design, surface plot and contour plot are provided. In the case of Mixture Design, surface plots and contour plots are provided, and when Process Variable is added, main effect plots and interaction plots for process variables are provided.\nHowever, the final step of DOE can be said to be the response optimizer. Response optimizer is not simply aimed at maximizing or maximizing the response value of a regression model. Of course, this partial purpose can be fully achieved by adjusting various input values. Response optimizer, as DOE calls it, is a useful tool for meeting more general purposes. For example, if there are two or more response values in an experiment and you want to make one response value larger and one response value smaller, this can be solved by creating a new function and addressing the problem of increasing this function. Of course, this function will grow when the first response value is large, and it will grow when the second response value is small. After this, we will explain how to mathematically formalize this to reach the goal.\n\n6.1.4.4.1. Desirability Function\n\nThere is one desirability function for one reaction column. If there is only one reaction column, you need to find a combination of the levels of factors that optimize this one desirability function.

This is because the initial values can determine whether the algorithm finds a local optimum or a global optimum. ECMinerTM DOE provides the selection methods of factorial design, response surface design, starting from a grid point, starting from a random point, and starting from a user-defined point, and Mixture Design provides a method that starts with a random point selection.\n\nBeta\n\nDue to the nature of the algorithm, Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points is stored, and the convergence condition is that the maximum difference between Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points must be smaller than Beta. Therefore, for users who want a more accurate value, the desired goal can be achieved by making this Beta value minimal.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta is a measure that determines how far a point should be brought back into the restricted area when it goes out of the restricted area. However, empirically, the measure does not have a decisive effect on the performance of the algorithm.\n\nInitial Value Quantity: It is a decision to perform the algorithm on a number of different initial values.\n\nMax Repetition Count\n\nIt determines the maximum number of times to repeat the algorithm.
