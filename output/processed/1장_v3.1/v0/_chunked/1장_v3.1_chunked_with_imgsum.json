Most of the features of ECMiner™ are pull-down menus easily accessible to non-technical users. Academics with expertise in analytical algorithms collaborated in the early days of the development ECMiner™. Subsequent versions are developed for providing a variety of data management, transforming, and model evaluation for real-world problems.\nThe key advantage of ECMiner™ is the following:\n\nLarge-Scale Data Handling\n\nIt supports various types of database formats, ECL (a proprietary data structure), TEXT, EXCEL, etc. Large volumes of data are manageable.\n\nUser-friendly tool\n\nPull and drag option for modeling is very convenient to users from loading data to analytics. Easily modified model deleting to adding nodes in analytical schema.\n\nScalability\n\nConfiguration of full model is easily modified.\n\nDiverse Analytical Features\n\nPrediction, classification, clustering, and Association Rules (AR), a powerful preprocessing node, a data browser, and charting for data visualization.",
